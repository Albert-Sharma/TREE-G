# TREE-G - Decision Trees with Dynamic Graph Features
TREE-Gs are decision trees specialized for graph data. They can be used for classificaiton, regression, vertex-labeling, graph-labeling, and edge-labeling.
The model is discussed in the paper [Decision Trees with Dynamic Graph Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02760)
The library is Scikit compatible.

## Getting Started
